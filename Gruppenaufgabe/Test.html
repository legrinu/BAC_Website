				<p> Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites.

					Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a placeholding temperament. I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different? Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes!
					
					Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision. We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women.
					
					The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive. The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different? Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot.
					
					I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text. If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it.</p>
